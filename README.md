#my_blog by miguelitomola

This is a project to create a personal blog to write my progress learning to code. 

It is built as a Rails app. To create it, I have followed the guide "getting started" placed in the Rails guides [website](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html "getting started").

The project is now under construction. 

I am implementing authentication with the authlogic gem, and trying to create an admin user with special rights to create and edit the blog contents.

I hope you enjoy it!
